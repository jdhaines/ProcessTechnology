# ProcessTechnology
Shared Repo for Process Technology files

This will be the main place where the Process Technology can share code samples, code projects, data sets, and anything else we might need related to programming which may require version control.

It may be a good idea to keep a high level list of projects with at least short descriptions in this file.  Folders in the repo will keep track of the files.  We can use the wiki feature for any detailed discussion or descriptions.  We should consider using jupyter notebooks for any type of python based coding we may want to show someone else.  Github has nice support for that.
